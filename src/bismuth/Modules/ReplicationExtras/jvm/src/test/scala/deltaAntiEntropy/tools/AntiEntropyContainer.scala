/** BasicCRDTs are Delta CRDTs that use [[IAntiEntropy]] and [[Network]] as Middleware for exchanging deltas between replicas.
  * They cannot actually be used on multiple connected replicas, but are useful for locally testing the behavior of
  * Delta CRDTs.
  *
  * Generated deltas are automatically propagated to the registered [[IAntiEntropy]] instance, but to apply deltas received
  * by the AntiEntropy instance you need to explicitly call processReceivedDeltas on the CRDT.
